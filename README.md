# Algorithmic-Approach-to-Carpooling

This project suggests and implements two methods for calculating the best routs for a car-pooling system. 
The two suggested methods where tabu search and genetic algorithms. The project was implemented using python for the backend, 
and HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the front end.
